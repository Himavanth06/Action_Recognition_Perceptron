<b>Human Action Recognition using Perceptron Neural Network<b/>

This project implements a Human Action Recognition System using a Perceptron Neural Network.
The model is trained on labeled human action images and classifies an input image into actions such as walking, running, sitting, and standing.

The system follows a supervised learning approach where images are preprocessed, converted into feature vectors, and learned using a multi-class perceptron model.

 Key Highlights

Perceptron-based neural network implementation

Perceptron Neural Network

Usage

Train the perceptron model using labeled action images.

Provide a new image as input.

The model predicts the human action performed in the image.

 Outcome

The project demonstrates how a Perceptron Neural Network can be applied to an image-based classification problem and forms a strong foundation for advanced neural network and computer vision systems.
